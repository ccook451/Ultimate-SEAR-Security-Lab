# Ultimate-SEAR-Security-Lab

This repository documents the setup and configuration of Proxmox and pfSense for a hybrid home lab environment. The steps include setting up Proxmox, installing pfSense as a virtual machine, configuring network settings for internal LAN and WAN access, and deploying a vulnerable lab environment for penetration testing practice.

## Overview
This lab serves as a platform for learning virtualization, networking, and ethical hacking using open-source tools. Proxmox provides the virtualization layer, while pfSense acts as the firewall and router for internal network segmentation.

### Why Use This Lab?
- **Hands-on Learning:** Build practical skills in system administration, networking, and cybersecurity.
- **Safe Vulnerable Environment:** Deploy vulnerable VMs like Metasploitable 2 for penetration testing without risk to your main network.
- **Network Security Practice:** Explore segmentation, VPN setup, and secure access using pfSense and WireGuard.
